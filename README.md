Housing Price Prediction

Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project is designed to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes datasets to train models and evaluate their performance in predicting the sale price of houses. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the data and implements various predictive models to achieve accurate results.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare datasets for analysis.
Exploration and visualization of housing data to identify trends and patterns.
Implementation of multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
User-friendly Jupyter Notebook interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.

Purpose
This project aims to provide insights into the housing market by predicting house prices based on historical data. It serves as a practical application of data analytics and machine learning techniques, showcasing how predictive modeling can be utilized in real-world scenarios to aid potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions.
