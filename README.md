# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and the implementation of multiple regression models to provide accurate predictions. It serves as an excellent example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world datasets.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for model training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).
- Model Implementation: Use of Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for predicting house prices.
- Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score are used to evaluate model performance.

## Purpose
This project aims to predict housing prices based on historical data and various features like location, number of rooms, and square footage. By analyzing and training on real-world housing data, it provides a robust model that could help homeowners, investors, and real estate professionals estimate property values more accurately.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure that the following are installed:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter notebook

You can install all dependencies via:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sk-17589/HousingPricePrediction.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd HousingPricePrediction

3.Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook housing_price_prediction.ipynb

5. Run the notebook: Execute the cells sequentially to load the data, train the model, and generate predictions.

## Running the Model
The model uses training data from housing_train.csv to predict house prices in the test dataset housing_test.csv. After running the notebook, the predictions will be saved in the file predictions.csv.
